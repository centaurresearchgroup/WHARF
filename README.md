WHARF - Wearable Human Activity Recognition Folder
--------------------------------------------------


1. What is it?
--------------
WHARF - Wearable Human Activity Recognition Folder is a public repository of code
and data sets for Human Activity Recognition systems based on information provided
by wearable sensors.

WHARF is composed of:

- WHARF Data Set, a collection of labelled accelerometer data recordings
  (obtained by a single wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer) to be used for the
  creation and validation of acceleration models of simple human activities.

- WHARF Code, a collection of MATLAB functions allowing for the creation and
  validation of the models and trials in WHARF Data Set. Detailed descriptions
  of the proposed system and its performance can be found at:
