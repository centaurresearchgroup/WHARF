WHARF Code
----------


1. What is it?
--------------
WHARF Code - Wearable Human Activity Recognition Folder Code is a public MATLAB
library for the creation and validation of acceleration models of simple human
activities, called Human Motion Primitives (HMP). Human Motion Primitives allow for
the recognition of mechanical, location-independent Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

WHARF Code provides the following functionalities:
- create the model of a HMP (on the basis of the corresponding modelling dataset)
- choose any combination of models
- compare a validation trial with the chosen models
- add, modify and delete models
- add, modify and delete validation trials
